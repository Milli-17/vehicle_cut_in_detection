**INTRODUCTION**

Vehicle detection is a crucial aspect of road safety, and it has been a long-lasting dream of robotics researchers. The goal is to develop a vehicle-mounted driver assistance system that can alert the driver about an impending collision.

----------------------------
**OBJECTIVE**

The objective behind vehicle detection is to warn drivers about an impending rear-end collision, especially for autonomous vehicles driving in existing road infrastructure.

----------------------------
**METHODOLOGY**

Vehicle detection is a challenging task due to the great variability in vehicle appearance (shape, size, color, pose), complex outdoor environments, unpredictable interaction between traffic participants, night driving, and adverse weather and illumination conditions.

One approach to vehicle detection involves using a camera to capture images of the road ahead. The images are then processed to detect vehicles using various algorithms such as corner detection, horizontal and vertical projection of associated edge points, and region of interest selection.
